\usage{
convertUNFCCC_NDC(x, subtype, subset = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{MAgPIE object to be converted}

\item{subtype}{Capacity_YYYY_cond or Capacity_YYYY_uncond for Capacity Targets, Emissions_YYYY_cond or
Emissions_YYYY_uncond for Emissions targets, with YYYY NDC version year}

\item{subset}{String, designating the GDP scenarios to use. Only important when subtype = Emissions_x.}
}
\value{
Magpie object with Total Installed Capacity (GW) targets, target years differ depending upon the database.
}
\description{
Converts conditional and unconditional capacity targets into total capacity (GW) in target year
the Generation targets are similar to the capacity targets but include the capacity factors,
