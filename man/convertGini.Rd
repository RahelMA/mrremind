\title{Convert Gini}
\usage{
convertGini(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{MAgPIE object containing Gini data with World Bank codes, 2011-2100, in percent (range 0-100)}
}
\value{
MAgPIE object of the Gini data in ISO countries, range 0-1
}
\description{
Converts Gini data from readGini() to ISO country level.
Countries missing in the original data set will have their Gini set to zero (
a very small number for numerical reasons to be precise).
The original data range is 2011-2100 in one-year steps,
here we extend it to 2000-2150 in 5-year steps.
Values before (after) the original range are held fixed at 2011 (2100) levels.
Gini values for the SDP scenario are taken from the SSP1 scenario
